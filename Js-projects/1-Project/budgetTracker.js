 * Monthly income: $3000
 * Monthly expenses:
 * Rent: $1200
 * Groceries: $600
 * Utilities: $300
 * Entertainment: $200

! Operations to be performed:

*/

//Step1: Define the monthly income
let monthlyIncome = 3000;

//Step2: Expenses
let rent = 1200;
let groceries = 600;
let utilities = 300;
let entertainment = 200;

//Step3: calculate the total expenses
let totalExpenses = rent + groceries + utilities + entertainment;
console.log("TotalExpenses in a month is:--", totalExpenses);

//Step 4: Calculate the remaining savings using the Subtraction (-) operator
let remainingSavings = monthlyIncome - totalExpenses;
console.log("RemainingSavings in a month are:--",remainingSavings);

//Step 5: Calculate the percentage of income spent using the Division (/) and Multiplication (*) operators

let percentageSpent = ((totalExpenses / monthlyIncome) * 100).toFixed(2);
console.log("percentageSpent is:--", percentageSpent + "%");
